# JustDownloadThese

Simple downloader for files!
Had to make this when HTTrack failed to download large list of files (+1000),
and ParseDepth=0 didnt work (it kept parsing other pages too).

### Features
- Downloads list of files given into textbox (separated with newline)

### TODO
- Progress information (update datagrid row with colors or something)
- Support HTML page parsing (download all links from given url)
- Support download filters (download all links with given file extension)
- Save current settings and input list to settings data
- Delete current unfinished download on exit (so that it downloads again next time)
