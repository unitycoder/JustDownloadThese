# JustDownloadThese

Simple downloader for files!
Had to make this when HTTrack failed to download large list of files (+1000),
and ParseDepth=0 didnt work (it kept parsing other pages too).

### Features
- Downloads list of files given into textbox (separated with newline)
- Parse files from URL (give text filter, like: ".laz")
- Skip existing files (so can continue later)
- Show progress info
